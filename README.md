This is the second attempt to write a voxel engine for RPG game. The first version is here https://github.com/justvg/VoxelEngine/. <br/>
This time I want to write the whole engine without using any libraries. At the moment I use only GLEW and <math.h>, and I want to get rid of them eventually. Also this time I think about the architecture of the engine a little bit more. <br/>

Inspired by handmadehero.org and Cube World game.
